    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <br>
        <p> Welcome to my <em>Fallout 2</em> modding guide. </p> 
        <p> You might ask why I created this guide and still work on it because there already are tutorials out there. I just could go and play Fallout instead of wasting my time. <br>
            Your question is absolutely justified. </p>
        <p> This guide exists because I realized that if I want the kind of complete <em>Fallout 2</em> modding guide that I envisioned, it pretty much meant writing it myself.
            There are already some tutorials and knowledge all over the internet regarding Fallout 2 modding but these tutorials are almost ancient and the knowledge is fragmented. 
            I'm not going to ignore the older tutorials or knowledge instead I'll incorporate them into this guide.
            My goal is to create a coherent modding guide that covers every corner of Fallout 2 modding. </p>
        <p> That turned out to be quite an undertaking, but on the other hand, as far as I'm concerned <em>Fallout 2</em> is the best computer game ever made. </p>
