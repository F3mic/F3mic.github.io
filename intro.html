		<h3>Introduction</h3>

        <br>

            <p>Welcome to my <em>Fallout 2</em> modding guide. This guide exists because I realized that if I wanted the kind
                of complete <em>Fallout 2</em> moding guide that I envisioned, it pretty much meant writing it myself. That turned out to
                be quite an undertaking, but on the other hand, as far as I'm concerned <em>Fallout 2</em> is the best computer game
                ever made.</p>
            <p>There are already some tutorials and knowledge all over the internet regarding Fallout 2 modding 
                but these tutorials are almost ancient and the knowledge is fragmented. 
                I'm not going to ignore the older tutorials or knowledge instead I'll incorporate them into this guide.
                My goal is to create a coherent modding guide that covers every corner of Fallout 2 modding.</p>
