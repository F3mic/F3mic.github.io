    <h3>Scripting (Advanced)</h3>

        <h4>Compiling</h4>
            <p>After you wrote a script you need to compile it. What does that mean? 
                It means the script needs to be translated from human readable code to machine readable code.
                Decompiled scripts have the suffix .ssl, compiled ones (machine readable) have the suffix .int.
                So the engine knows what to do with the scripts content. 
                With vanilla Fallout 2 scripting you'll just be able to tell the engine what the behavior of something is.
                You cannot change things inside the engine itself with scripting.
                For this problem SFall has been created but this is a topic for another time.</p>
