    <h3>Scripting (Advanced)</h3>
    <br>

            <div id="compiling"><h4>Compiling</h4></div>
            <p>As you have probably already noticed, the suffix of your script or any script in general is .ssl. For example ASWELL.ssl. 
                However, this suffix is the raw state of a script. To be able to use your script inside the game you need to compile it. What does that mean? 
                It means the script needs to be translated from human readable code into machine readable code.
                Decompiled (human readable) scripts have the suffix .ssl, compiled ones (machine readable) have the suffix .int.
                So the engine knows what to do with the scripts content.</p>
            <p>But how exactly do we compile scripts? With Sfall script editor this is child's play.
                <br>
                Just look at the top center of the Sfall script editor. There you'll find this button.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="images\compile_button.png" alt="">
                <p>Press it. Come on, do it! Press it! Or F8...</p>
                <img src="images\compiling_success.png" alt="">
                <p>Yes! You did it! Do you feel the rush of power running through your veins? How does it feel? It feels goood...</p>
                <img src="images\ssl_and_int.png" alt="">
                <p>Ta-da! You compiled a .ssl script into a .int one. The compiled script will be created at the same place your decompiled script lies. You can be proud of yourself.</p>
                <!--With vanilla Fallout 2 scripting you'll just be able to tell the engine what the behavior of something is.
                You cannot change things inside the engine itself with scripting.
                For this problem SFall has been created but this is a topic for another time.</p>-->
            <br>

            <h5>Notice</h5>
            <p>* You can choose whatever name your script has. It doesn't matter if it's called ASWELL.ssl, WELL.ssl or MYSCRIPT.ssl. 
                But remember, and this is important, a scripts name mustn't be longer than 8 characters, the suffix .ssl not counted.
                It mustn't be exactly 8 characters long either. Just pick a name between min. 1 and max. 8 chars long.
                If you don't follow this rule you'll burn in hell for all eternity!!! And your sleeves slip down every time washing your hands!!!
                The truth is the engine can't handle more than 8 chars and will probably crash. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
            <p>* Script names and the suffix aren't case sensitive. It doesn't matter if you write ASWELL.SSL, ASWELL.int, aswell.SSL, aswell.INT, aSwElL.sSl... you're getting the point.</p>
