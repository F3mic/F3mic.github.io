    <h3>Scripting (Advanced)</h3>
    <br>

            <div id="compiling"><h4>Compiling</h4></div>
            <p>As you have probably already noticed, the suffix of your script or any script in general is .ssl. For example ASWELL.ssl. 
                However, this suffix is the raw state of a script. To be able to use your script inside the game you need to compile it. What does that mean? 
                It means the script needs to be translated from human readable code into machine readable code.
                Decompiled (human readable) scripts have the suffix .ssl, compiled ones (machine readable) have the suffix .int.
                So the engine knows what to do with the scripts content.</p>
            <p>But how exactly do we compile scripts? With Sfall script editor this is child's play.
                <br>
                Just look at the top center of the Sfall script editor. There you'll find this button.</p>

                <p>ヾ( ๑´д`๑)ﾂ oh noez! What happened? It didn't compile... You get some unique and some cryptic error messages. But all in all it didn't compile. But how do we get our script correctly compiled?
                    I'm glad you ask. Maybe you noticed some little detail inside ASWELL.SSL.</p>

                <p>In order to compile your script correctly, it must be listed inside SCRIPTS.H. Let's take a look at SCRIPTS.H located here:</p>

                            Purpose: This file contains defines for all of the scripts in
                                        scripts.lst. This is an ordered list and needs to
                                        conform exactly to scripts list. All defines in here
                                        need to be prepended with SCRIPT_ as a naming
                                        convention.

                <p>What the heck is this?! You might ask. This is SCRIPTS.H or a itsy bitsy tiny part of it (I shorted it because of reasons ;-)). Ok, let's take a look at the framework of this file.</p>
                <p>#define SCRIPT_... looks familiar. So there needs to be something like #define SCRIPT_ASWELL inside SCRIPTS.H. Let's seek for it.</p>
                    <code>
                        <pre>
                            //#define SCRIPT_ASWELL           (217)   // ASWell.int      ; Arroyo Well. It's broken. Fix w/ Repair
                        </pre>
                    </code>
                <p>There it is! Line 236! It didn't work because someone put double slash before it to make it a comment... (；￣Д￣）</p>
                <p>Just remove the double slash. It'd now look like this.</p>
                    <code>
                        <pre>
                            #define SCRIPT_ASWELL           (217)   // ASWell.int      ; Arroyo Well. It's broken. Fix w/ Repair
                        </pre>
                    </code>
                <p>Okay. Now you should more or less understand #define SCRIPT_ASWELL. But what's up with (217)? It serves the purpose of a placeholder or some kind of link. So, to make things short SCRIPT_ASWELL = 217.
                    Humans use SCRIPT_ASWELL because it's easier to read and engines work with numbers so 217 is easier for the engine to understand. Every script has its unique number. Every number is assigned once.
                    Explore SCRIPTS.H to understand this procedure better.</p>
                <p>Now give it another try. Save the file SCRIPTS.H. Push the button.</p>

                <p>Just kidding.</p>
                <img src="images\compiling_success.png" alt="">
                <p>Yes! You did it! Do you feel the rush of power running through your veins? How does it feel? It feels goood...</p>
                <img src="images\ssl_and_int.png" alt="">
                <p>Ta-da! You compiled a .ssl script into a .int one. The compiled script will be created at the same place your decompiled script lies. You can be proud of yourself.</p>
            <br>

            <h5>Notice</h5>
            <p>* You can choose whatever name your script has. It doesn't matter if it's called ASWELL.ssl, WELL.ssl or MYSCRIPT.ssl. 
                But remember, and this is important, a scripts name mustn't be longer than 8 characters, the suffix .ssl not counted.
                It mustn't be exactly 8 characters long either. Just pick a name between min. 1 and max. 8 chars long.
                If you don't follow this rule you'll burn in hell for all eternity!!! And your sleeves slip down every time washing your hands!!!
                The truth is the engine can't handle more than 8 chars and will probably crash. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
            <p>* Script names and the suffix aren't case sensitive. It doesn't matter if you write ASWELL.SSL, ASWELL.int, aswell.SSL, aswell.INT, aSwElL.sSl... you're getting the point.</p>
