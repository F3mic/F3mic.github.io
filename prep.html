                <p>What do you need for modding Fallout 2 you ask? Well let's begin with scripting. 
                    You can take a simple text editor like notepad or notepad++ with or without
                    <a href="https://nma-fallout.com/threads/vscode-ssl-support.217033/">Burns VScode SSL support</a> to write scripts. 
                    But we take a more dedicated tool for this task. The tool we're going to use is called SFall Script Editor by Mr. Stalin.
                    This <a href="https://www.nma-fallout.com/resources/sfall-script-editor.77/">tool</a> is gold and will save us a lot of work.</p>

                <p>If you want to just write scripts and hope they'll work you'll be fine. 
                    But if you want to be sure your scripts work you can do this in severals ways.
                    How you do test your scripts will be discussed at a later time.
                    The maybe quickest way is following tool.
                    It's the good old <a href="https://www.nma-fallout.com/resources/bis-mapper.55/">Black Isle Studio (BIS) Mapper</a>.
                    Inside the BIS Mappers folder you'll find decompiled (human readable) scripts from Fallout 2.
                    Keep these decompiled scripts save and untouched. Make a copy of them because we're going to work and manipulate alot with these files.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Compiling</h4>
                <p>After you wrote a script you need to compile it. What does that mean? 
                    It means the script needs to be translated from human readable code to machine readable code.
                    Decompiled scripts have the suffix .ssl, compiled ones (machine readable) have the suffix .int.
                    So the engine knows what to do with the scripts content. 
                    With vanilla Fallout 2 scripting you'll just be able to tell the engine what the behavior of something is.
                    You cannot change things inside the engine itself with scripting.
                    For this problem SFall has been created but this is a topic for another time.</p>

                <p>If you want to map you'd use the before mentioned BIS Mapper. You can also use 
                    <a href="https://www.nuclear-city.com/index.php/topic/1054-%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82-bis-%D0%B8-dims-fallout-1-2/">
                    Dims Mapper (russian speaking site)</a> as complentary. You'll also find a modified version of BIS Mapper under the russian link.</p>
