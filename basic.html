            <div id="scr"><h4>Script</h4></div>
                <p>A script is a container that contains the source code of the Fallout scripting language. 
                    Any object in the game can have a script so that it can be interacted with.</p>
            <br>
            <div id="profu"><h4>Procedure<!--/Function--></h4></div>
                <p>Procedures are just like small programs. Sometimes they are called sub-programs. 
                    They are an essential part of program and help programmers to avoid repetitions since they promote code re-use. 
                    A procedure in Pascal starts with a begin and ends with an end just like a program;. 
                    It can also have its own variables called local variables. 
                    Local variables belonging to procedures cannot be used with the main-program. 
                    Variables declared in a program are called global variables.</p>
                <!--<p>A function returns a value and a procedure just executes commands.
                    The name function comes from math. It is used to calculate a value based on input.
                    A procedure is a set of commands which can be executed in order.
                    In most programming languages, even functions can have a set of commands. Hence the difference is only returning a value.
                    But if you like to keep a function clean, (just look at functional languages), you need to make sure a function does not have a side effect.</p>-->

                    <p>This variable is of type Map variable (MVAR). This variable is saved during map change. MVARs are stored in the corresponding map script. 
                        In this case MVAR_Fixed_Well is stored in arvillag.H. With the include command the MVAR can be used in the script. 
                        Map variables need to be added to a file called mapName.gam which must be put in the data\maps directory.</p>

                    <p>This variable is of type Global variable. They can be used in any script. To use these variables, only the file global.H must be included in the script. 
                        These variables are saved during the map change. Any global variables you #define and use must also be put into a file called VAULT13.gam which is found in the data\data directory. 
                        Global Vars will be stored in a header file called Global.h, located in the \Fallout2\Scripts\Headers\ directory. 
                        All global vars will be prepended with GVAR_ to differentiate them from all other variables.</p>

                    A good example is give_xp(EXP_FIX_WELL) because EXP_FIX_WELL is a constant which is defined in ExpPoint.H. 
                    If you use EXP_FIX_WELL in several scripts and you want to change the given experience from 100 to 200 you just need to change the value in on place, in ExpPoint.H.</p>
