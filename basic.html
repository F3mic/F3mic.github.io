    <h3>Scripting (Basics)</h3>
    <br>

        <div id="ssl"><h4>SSL - Star Trek scripting language</h4></div>
            <p> No, you have not misread, the scripting language used to script Fallout 2 is called Star Trek scripting language or in short SSL. 
                SSL is a mix of pascal, or lua with C. Only the devs know what this abomination is.
                Black Isle Studios created SSL for their Star Trek game that never came true. When they made Fallout 1 and 2 they simply used SSL to script them.
                Some refer to it as Fallout scripting language, some as Star Trek scripting language and some just call it SSL but all mean the same.
                If you want to know more you can ask the community, they should know more about it.</p>
         <br>

        <div id="script"><h4>Script</h4></div>
            <p> A script is just a file that contains the source code of the Fallout scripting language. 
                Any object in the game can have a script. 
                Scripts are needed to assign a certain behavior to an object (critter, scenery, items etc.), 
                so that it can be interacted with. They breathe life into the game world and its inhabitants.
                Not only the player can interact with scripts,
                but even scripts can interact with eachother. 
                You could also build a map and place critters, scenery and stuff without assigning scripts to them.
                You could nevertheless interact with them but not that much.
                What does it mean "not that much"?
                Well, the game uses default scripts if you don't assign any like combat, push, look, description etc.</p>
        
            <p> Letâ€™s see how a script can look like. The following is the script for the well found in Arroyo village.</p>

                </code>
            <p> At first glance it can look overwelming even intimidating. But fear not! We will go through this step by step. First of all we will look at the structure.</p>
        <br>

        <div id="procedure"><h4>Procedure</h4></div>
            <p> Procedures are just like small programs inside your script. They are an essential part of the program and help programmers to keep the script clear, organized, structured and avoid repetitions since they promote code re-use. 
                A procedure in Fallout scripting language starts with <span class="dyestatement">procedure </span> a name (<span class="dyeprocedure">start</span> in this case) <span class="dyestatement">begin</span>  
                and ends with an <span class="dyestatement">end</span> statement.</p>
                It usually looks like the example below:
                <!-- The part below doesn't fit into here.-->
                <!--It can also have its own variables called local variables. 
                Local variables belonging to procedures cannot be used with the main-program. 
                Variables declared in a program are called global variables.-->
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        <span class="dyestatement">procedure</span> <span class="dyeprocedure">start</span> <span class="dyestatement">begin</span>
                        <span class="dyestatement">end</span>
                    </pre>
                </code>
            <p> The space between <span class="dyestatement">begin</span> and <span class="dyestatement">end</span> is called procedure body. Inside the body you write the stuff you want to be executed.
                In the example above the body is empty. An empty procedure body cannot execute anything because there is nothing to execute. If you call an empty procedure, the procedure starts, sees there's nothing inside the body
                and ends immediately.</p>
            <p> We have four procedures in this example. start; use_skill_on_p_proc; description_p_proc and look_at_p_proc. There are more but this scripts just uses these four. They are predefinied by the devs but you can also write your own procecures</p>
            <p> The most important procedure of them all is the procedure called "start". The start procedure is the entry point of every script. Every script has it and every script needs it. If you don't have the start procedure inside you script, it won't work.</p>
        <br>

        <div id="command"><h4>Command</h4></div>
            <p> These are the commands of SSL. The stuff you write inside the procedure body. These commands are hardcoded. That means they are basis commands, they cannot be broken down further.</p>
            <p> A simple command can look like this:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        <span class="dyecommand">display_msg</span>
                    </pre>
                </code>
        <br>
        <div id="function"><h4>Function</h4></div>
            <p> You can also write something more complex like this:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        <span class="dyecommand">display_msg</span>(<span class="dyecommand">message_str</span>(SCRIPT_GENERIC,<span class="dyedefine">1005</span>));
                    </pre>
                </code>
            <p> As you can see there is a command inside a command and some other stuff. That's also possible. So if you combine commands and other stuff together and it's becoming more complex we speak of functions.</p>
        <br>

        <div id="argument/parameter"><h4>Argument</h4></div>
            <p>But what's the stuff inside the parenthesis? It's called argument or parameter. I refer to them as argument inside this guide.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        <span class="dyecommand">display_msg</span>(<span class="dyecommand">message_str</span>(SCRIPT_GENERIC,<span class="dyedefine">1005</span>));
                    </pre>
                </code>
            <p>Many commands need to pass something and what they pass is called an argument. If the concept of the arguments is not quite clear to you yet, don't worry, more about that later.</p>
        <!--<p> This give_xp(x) gives a certain amount of experience points to the player and displays a message to the player so he is informed how many exp points he received. 
                The amount of the exp points given is defined with the symbol between the brackets, in this example (x). This is called an argument or parameter.</p>-->
        <br>

        <div id="variable"><h4>Variable</h4></div>
            <p> The variable <strong>Only_Once</strong> is defined outside the procedure and assigned the value <span class="dyedefine">0</span>. 
                This variable can be used in every procedure inside the script. This variable will not be saved when changing the map.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>

            <p>The variable item is defined inside the procedure <span class="dyeprocedure">combat_p_proc</span>.
                This variable can only be used inside the procedure. This variable will not be saved when changing the map.</p>
                <code>

            <p>This variable is defined inside script ARCAVES.SSL. The keyword export ensures that the variable can be used in other scripts. 
                The variable contains the last value that was assigned to it.</p>
                <code>

                </code>
            <p>The previously exported variable can now be used with the keyword import in the scripts AITEMCST.SSL and ACTEMVIL.SSL. 
                The variable contains the value that was last assigned to it.</p>
                <code>

                </code>
            <p>This variable is of type Local variable (LVAR). This variable is saved during map change.</p>

                </code>
            <p>This variable is of type Map variable (MVAR). This variable is saved during map change. MVARs are stored in the corresponding map script. 
                In this case MVAR_Fixed_Well is stored in arvillag.H. With the include command the MVAR can be used in the script. 
                Map variables need to be added to a file called mapName.gam which must be put in the data\maps directory.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>

                </code>
            <p>This variable is of type Global variable. They can be used in any script. To use these variables, only the file global.H must be included in the script. 
                These variables are saved during the map change. Any global variables you #define and use must also be put into a file called VAULT13.gam which is found in the data\data directory. 
                Global Vars will be stored in a header file called Global.h, located in the \Fallout2\Scripts\Headers\ directory. 
                All global vars will be prepended with GVAR_ to differentiate them from all other variables.</p>
                <code>

        <div id="constant"><h4>Constant</h4></div>
            <p>Constants are variables with one-time fixed unchangeable value. A good example is give_xp(EXP_FIX_WELL) because EXP_FIX_WELL is a constant which is defined in ExpPoint.H. 
                If you use EXP_FIX_WELL in several scripts and you want to change the given experience from 100 to 200 you just need to change the value in on place, in ExpPoint.H.</p>
                <code>

        <div id="macro"><h4>Macro</h4></div>
            <p>Found in the file EXPPOINT.H give_xp(x) is a macro of a couple of functions like give_exp_points(x); display_msg[â€¦] and message_str[â€¦] combined.</p>

        <div id="header"><h4>Header File</h4></div>
            <p>Header files are files that store information that is used repeatedly in every script. 
                So, you donâ€™t have to rewrite certain functions, arguments, variables every time you want to use them. 
                Just include the header file you want to use inside your script and youâ€™re good to go.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        <span class="dyedefine">#include</span> <span class="dyeheader">"..\headers\command.h"</span>
                    </pre>
                </code>
            <p>You must do this step so that the compiler is able to compile your script.</p>
