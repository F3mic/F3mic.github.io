    <h3>Test your script within the BIS Mapper</h3>
    <br>
    
        <h4>SCRIPTS.LST</h4>
            <p>Now that you've got a compiled script you certainly want to test it. One way to test it is within the BIS Mapper. But first we have to add the script into SCRIPTS.LST.
                We need to do this so that the mapper is able to find the script. Locate the file and open it with whatever editor you like. Jump at the end of the file and add your script like this:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        HCPAVEL.INT		; Pavel the former scout of Home.				# local_vars=3
                    </pre>
                </code>
            <p>HCPAVEL.INT is the name of your compiled script how you of course already noticed. The text after the semicolon is a descriptive text. 
                The text after the hashtag is the amount of LVARs (LVARs = local variables = local_vars) used inside your script. In this example you see that script HCPAVEL.int uses 3 LVARs. 
                If you use 0 LVARs then you write # local_vars=0. If you use 5 but write # local_vars=7 nobody will tear your head off the script will work anyways.
                The important thing is that you add your script at the same line number as the entry inside SCRIPTS.H corresponds.
                E.g. inside SCRIPTS.H SCRIPT_HCPAVEL has number (1034) so your entry inside SCRIPTS.LST needs to be on line number 1304.</p>
            <p>Now open the BIS Mapper. At the dropdown menu change to "Critters" and place a critter of your choice. Mark the critter and press the button "edit". 
                An overview window of the char called "Critter Instance Editor critters" should appear. Inside this windows click on "New script".
                An window with a lot of scripts to choose from should appear. Search manually for HCPAVEL.int, choose it and </p>    
            <br>

            <h5>Notice</h5>
            <p>* If you see your script inside the mapper and attach it to a critter but you cannot interact with the critter how you've supposed it with your script then the error could be following:</p>
            <p>&nbsp; * Your script isn't located inside the same folder as SCRIPTS.LST.</p>        
            <p>&nbsp; * The entry of your script inside SCRIPTS.LST doesn't correspond with the entry inside SCRIPTS.H.</p>
